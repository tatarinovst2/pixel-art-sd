# Fine-tuning StableDiffusion for Pixel Art Generation

## Overview

This project aims to adapt the StableDiffusion model to create high-quality pixel art by fine-tuning it on specialized pixel art datasets.

## Roadmap

1. **Gather Datasets**
    - **Primary Dataset:** [Pixel Art Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ebrahimelgazar/pixel-art)
    - **Additional Datasets:** Source images of varying sizes and styles to enhance model versatility.

2. **Preprocess Data**
    - **Image Resizing:** Upsize images (for example, a 16x16 pixel art would become a 128x128 image (maybe 256x256?)) to maintain pixel integrity.

3. **Train StableDiffusion**
    - **LoRa:** Use LoRa for optimal fine-tuning.

4. **Downsize Images**
    - **Preprocessing:** Downsize images with some algorithm to maintain pixel integrity.

## Challenges

- **Image Downsizing:** Maintaining pixel integrity during resizing to avoid loss of the pixelated style.
- **Dataset Diversity:** Ensuring a wide variety of pixel art styles and sizes to make the model robust.
